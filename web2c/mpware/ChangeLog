Sun Oct 19 11:00:35 1997  Olaf Weber  <infovore@xs4all.nl>

	* makempx.in: Removed web2c maintainer's name.

	* newer.c (main): Removed web2c maintainer's name.  Use int main,
	not void main.

	* mpto.c (main): Removed web2c maintainer's name.  Main returns
 	and int, not void.

Fri Oct 17 14:07:21 1997  Olaf Weber  <infovore@xs4all.nl>

Tue Sep 30 16:29:17 1997  Olaf Weber  <infovore@xs4all.nl>

	* Makefile.in: Insert version string into makempx.
	* makempx.in (mode): Modified to get version string from Makefile.

	* newer.c, mpto.c: Modified to use version string from c-auto.h.

	*tex..etex block encountered is a verbatimtex..etex block.

Thu Feb 13 16:18:39 1997  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install-exec): makempx is in the build directory,
	not srcdir.
	From: Andreas Schott <ays@rzg.mpg.de>.

Mon Jan 20 17:30:44 1997  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

	* Version 7.0.

Mon Dec  9 01:31:55 1996  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx.in: Use `basename $0` in usage and version messages 
	for consistency with other programs and scripts.

	* makempx.in: Fix a confusion between TROFF_INERR and TROFF_OUTERR.

	* makempx.in: Remove unfinished $MPXFILE if an error occurs rather
	than leaving behind a broken version that might confuse $NEWER.

	* newer.c, mpto.c, dmp.c: Reformat usage message for consistency.
	
	* newer.c (main): Back out unnecessary usage() function again.
	All cases of incorrect input were already caught before.

	* mpto.c (main): Issue "Need exactly one file arg. Try --help" 
	message if called with no arguments.
 	
	* dmp.c (main): Issue "Need one or two file args. Try --help"
 	message if called with no arguments.
	This makes it impossible to use dmp as a filter reading from
 	stdin, but it's more in line with the behavior of dvitomp.

	* dmp.c (main): Exit after perror() if file opening failed.
  	This might have been the reason for some remaining seg faults.
	
Tue Dec  3 18:06:46 1996  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx.in: Must use `eval $TROFF' to get the `eqn | troff' 
	pipeline to work as intended.

	* newer.c, mpto.c: Oops, can't use printversionandexit after all
	without linking with kpathsea.  Not worth it.
	Just write out the notice.

Tue Oct  8 16:46:17 1996  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

	* *.c: Call printversionandexit for --version.
	* makempx.in: Change --version output.

	* dmp.c: Also print kpathsea_version_string if --version.
	Give perror if open of argument files for reading/writing fail.

	* Makefile.in (newer, mpto): Include $(proglib) for versionstring.

Fri Jul 26 15:47:57 1996  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Remove co.make.

Sat Jun  8 13:15:01 1996  K. Berry  <kb@cs.umb.edu>

	* Makefile.in (newer, mpto): Use $(LIBS) $(XLOADLIBES) for these
        standalone programs instead of $(LOADLIBES), a la squeeze
        (dmp): Use $(kpathsea_link).

        * makempx.in: Use filename.tex if converting to TeX. From Ulrik.

        * mpto.c (main): Check mpfile for the fopen failing, not mpname.
        Implement a -E <errfile> option.
        (usage): Have a -E option on the Amiga.
        From Andreas Scherer.

Sat Sep 30 15:56:47 1995  Karl Berry  <karl@cs.umb.edu>

Thu Apr 13 16:40:08 1995  Ulrik Vieth  <vieth@thphy.uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* makempx, troffmpx: replaced by templates makempx.in, troffmpx.in.
	The actual shell scripts are produced by sed, replacing @BINDIR@
	by the actual installation directory $(bindir), which is known to
	the Makefile when invoked as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* newer.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".

	* mptotex.c, mptotr.c: no changes needed. 

	* dvitomp.ch: complete rewrite, incorporating material from
	../dviutil/dviutil.ch and the original dvitomp.ch.

	* dmp.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".  
	Also include a special header file "dmp.h" containing MetaPost 
	specific stuff that isn't found in "c-auto.h".  Use MPSUPPORT
	instead of MPPOOL as the directory for troff support files.

	* dmp.h.in: added new template file for "dmp.h". The actual header
	file is produced by sed, repacing @TEXMF@ by the actual library
	directory $(texmf), which is known to the Makefile when invoked
	as a sub-make from the top-level Makefile.

	* pathexp.c: include "c-auto.h" as a replacement for "site.h".
	Use `#ifdef HAVE_DIRENT_H' and `#ifdef HAVE_STRING_H' instead
	of `#ifdef BSD'.  (There still remains one case of `#ifdef SYSV'
	that needs to be checked.)

	during configure run.
